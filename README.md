# TBN Advent of Code 2025

Welcome fellow nerds and biscuits enjoyer. This year, we will once again embark on our tradition of collectively doing the first few days of AoC before progressively giving up and looking in awe as one of our rust overlord actually sees it through, somehow.

We're an eco-first discord, so we're recycling our leaderboard for the third time. You can find it [->HERE<-](https://adventofcode.com/2025/leaderboard/private/view/1135344).

If you're not on the leaderboard yet, you can just go to the [main leaderboards page](https://adventofcode.com/2025/leaderboard/private) and enter code `1135344-2b0faf05`.

See you on Dec 1st!
